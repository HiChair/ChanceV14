'guild'             :       refers to discord server
'intents'           :       events you wish to receive from discord.js client (less events = less bandwidth) 
'emphemeral'        :       Only the person who sent the message will see



'module.exports' [ how you export data in Node.js so that you can 'require()' it in other files ]     
'interaction.client' [ access client instance inside a command file ]

returning a promise and the .then() method indicate a function is asynchronous


ytdl-core shitting the bed for Node v16 which is needed for discord.js v14 (gonna use youtube-dl-exec instead)

need to Make a collection to keep track of voice state for different servers like I did with players
